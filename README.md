# PlumFlower
Searchless transformer-based Xiangqi engine trained off of Pikafish annotations

## What is this?
PlumFlower is an academic project focused on replicating Deepmind's success in searchless chess for the game of Xiangqi (Chinese chess). The goal is now raw playing strength, so this repository is largely unoptimized.
